# Muxingbird

Muxingbird is a lightweight Go-based CLI tool that spins up mock HTTP servers from a JSON spec file.
Designed for testing, prototyping, and mocking RESTful APIs, Muxingbird lets you simulate real
server responses in seconds.

Inspired by the concepts of "mux" (HTTP routing) and the mockingbird, Muxingbird sings back exactly
what you want your mock API to say.
